CMD and Entry point

CMD is used to execute specific command

it can be there in Docker file in one of these formats

CMD program arg  --> CMD sleep 5
CMD["prog","arg"] --> CMD ["sleep","5"]

if CMD is passed while running, it overrides cmd present in docker file
> docker run ubuntu sleep 10

Entrypoint is used to send either arg or both dynamically.

Different form of entrypoint is explained below:

ENTRYPOINT["sleep"] --> docker run ubuntu 10

-----------
With default value

ENTRYPOINT["sleep"]
CMD["5"]
> docker run ubuntu 10 --> sleeps for 10 sec
> docker run ubuntu --> Sleeps for 5 seconds as default is set to 5

-----------
Setting ENTRYPOINT dynamically while running:
docker run --entrypoint sleep2.0 ubuntu 10

This will relace sleep with sleep2.0 and 5 with 10 in original docker command
